# IN CONSTRUCTION!
Thank you to ApexInvent for [working on these astonishing Tz2.0 CAD files!](https://github.com/ApexInvent/Trianglelab_TZ2.0-CAD)<br>
Take a look at [this K1C hotend](https://www.printables.com/model/1018088-creality-k1k1c-hotend-alternative-clone-assembly-c) as well!<br>
This project started on February 3rd of 2026.<br>
It is work in progress, with 75% of it being done.<br>
Expect the initial release today.<br>

# "Unicorn who?"
I disliked the reality of MK8 nozzles being less available [than the V6.](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-silicon%20carbide%20nozzle.html)<br>
So I decided to adapt the V6 nozzle directly, and this hotend was born.<br>
[It's all](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/w9MUXdkAIyE) [V6 nozzles](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MytNVpzqd6E) [**anywhere I go**](https://youtu.be/A3jx4bZE3AU?si=cCZt-2aQlPrmg-7F&t=124), while we see MK8s less often.<br>
Now I can even get the one-buck V6 nozzle for a quick PLA/ABS print, while I wait for those [tungsten](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yoC52YAMKkI) nozzles.
