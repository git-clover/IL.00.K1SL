This project started on February 3rd of 2026.<br>
**HUGE** thanks to ApexInvent for [working on these astonishing Tz2.0 CAD files.](https://github.com/ApexInvent/Trianglelab_TZ2.0-CAD)<br>
Take a look at [this stock K1C hotend by squirrelf3d](https://www.printables.com/model/1018088-creality-k1k1c-hotend-alternative-clone-assembly-c) as well.<br>

## Look, 3 mm cartridges with the X1C hotend!
I designed it to use the advantages of both hotends. Look at the table below.

| Tz2.0 | Stock/Unicorn |
| -- | -- |
| X1C heaters | 3 mm thermistor cartridges |
| V6 nozzles | Easy fit on K1 printheads |

The disadvantages I experienced were:
| CHCB(X1C clone MK8) | Stock/Unicorn |
| -- | -- |
| Thermistor too weak | Easily clogs |
| Replacement quite expensive | **PROPRIETARY** |

# From prorpietary nozzles to V6
This story starts from a nice day of summer in 2025, where my Unicorn nozzle clogged for its 5th time.<br>
It failed so badly I was certain I would trash the existing heatsink. But I somehow recovered it, used a spare hotend, and went on as usual.<br>
**But it blobbed again!** This time, with no choice, I had to buy a new hotend.<br>
I thought, "If I have tried lots of Unicorn nozzles, then what about a new type with smaller ones? Should I try one?!"

## "Wait, smaller nozzles?!"
On a peaceful Tuesday of August, I finally went shopping for new nozzles.<br>
I was trying out many spools of PETG and PBT, while the TPU clogged all the time.<br>
This also reminded me that the hotend twisted open every time I tried to screw in the Unicorn nozzle.<br>
So, I swapped my hotend with the CHCB-OTC(K1C), found MK8 nozzles good, until...

## "No MK8 already?!"
I looked for [silicon carbide nozzles](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-silicon%20carbide%20nozzle.html), [but only **TWO** were for MK8 hotends!](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-mk8-silicon-carbide.html)<br>
And they were all 0.4, which basically eliminates the [point of reinforced nozzles.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xz8iOlz_i_c)<br>
So I decided to adapt the V6 nozzle directly, but I hadn't had enough time to dig into this.<br>
When I happened to take vacations, I realized I had more time, sitting on my chair to open my CAD.<br>
I brought the needed models, mixed some features, and on February 5th of 2026, this hotend was born.
