# IN CONSTRUCTION!
Thank you to ApexInvent for [working on these astonishing Tz2.0 CAD files!](https://github.com/ApexInvent/Trianglelab_TZ2.0-CAD)<br>
Take a look at [this K1C hotend](https://www.printables.com/model/1018088-creality-k1k1c-hotend-alternative-clone-assembly-c) as well!<br>
This project started on February 3rd of 2026.<br>
It is work in progress, with 75% of it being done.<br>
Expect the initial release today.<br>

# "Unicorn who?"
A few months ago, I went shopping for new nozzles only to find it inefficient.<br>
So, I swapped my hotend with the CHCB-OTC(K1C), found MK8 nozzles good, until...

# "No MK8 already?!"
One day, I looked for those [SiC nozzles](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-silicon%20carbide%20nozzle.html).<br>
[But only **TWO** were for MK8 hotends!](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-mk8-silicon-carbide.html)<br>
And they're all 0.4, which basically eliminates the [point of reinforced nozzles.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xz8iOlz_i_c)<br>
So I decided to adapt the V6 nozzle directly, and this hotend was born.
