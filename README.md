# Welcome aboard.
- Design inspired by Kanrog's Kobra S1 bed frame.

- Actively managed and updated by IDOLABS, also on Printables.

- I only had basic tools to build this when I was designing this - Easy assembly guaranteed.

- It shines more when you swap the board.

- I am on Funssor!

- You can take the drawing file with the places to tap the threads for such CNC services like PCBWay/JLCCNC. I also found sheet metal cheaper than CNCs, so try them if possible.

- If you plan to upgrade more than just a bed, there you go. (Work in progress.)

| All K1 printers | Only for MAX | Caution |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| D3D 5015 / BCJ 4010 | D3D 5015 (remix) | 5015 mounts cannot be used with Triple Z. |
| Triple Z + Cableseal | Doorplug | You need to swap the mainboard first. |
| Level nuts | (none) | You may sometimes need to adjust the screw length. See BOM for extra details. |

- Measured with only my tape measure for the large areas. May not be accurate. If you found it inaccurate, tell me it's inaccurate in the comments. I want to, have to, and can't wait to hear from you. I'll also test this model to get the process faster. 

- Major thanks to Henlor for building the tough foundation for this experiment project. Take a look at what he did for the Creality K1.

- My frame is made out of aluminum 5052, weighing down to 300 g. The stock frame measured about 1.5 kg. You can reduce it down to (theoretically) 15 % of the original weight.

- This frame does NOT support the LiDAR sensor. You'll need to calibrate the filament yourself. Relying on algorithms that you didn't make is bad in the Klipper world. [You have no control over them](https://creality.com/) and will only waste time for [bad algorithms.](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-k1-max-3d-printer)

- I also provided the STEP file, so feel free to add your own fixes. I appreciate your work. When using without the load cells, you can fix the bed with four solid mounts.

## Changelogs?
- See Printables for [Changelogs and Updates.](https://www.printables.com/model/1444709-il00-k1sl-creality-k1-max-superlight-bed-frame#changelogs-and-updates-)

# Replacement
- It shouldn't take too long, but please, I beg you to [turn off your printer before doing this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwIvUbOhcKE&t=40s)

## Bill of materials.
| Name | Qty | Link | Caution |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Spacers (3*5*3 mm) | 6 |  Find in folder "Misc" | You may need a few spares. |
| Spring bed mounts (M4, Ø12 mm) | 4 | Spring - Aliexpress / Amazon | May be hard to tighten at first; Be careful not to bend the frame.<br>Buy **EITHER** the spring **OR** the silicone. |
| Silicone bed mounts (M4, Ø12 mm) | 4 | Silicone - Aliexpress / Amazon | May not reach the nozzle with a 12 mm height with the Oldham; I recommend 14 mm spacers. |
| M4*25/28/30 mm **FHCS** screws | 4 | Aliexpress  / Amazon | It heavily depends on the bed mounts and the bed itself that you used. Start with a 30 mm screw, tune it down till you get a good bed mesh, and use shorter ones. |
| M3*8 SHCS/BHCS | 13 | Aliexpress / Amazon | Use this screw for the PRTouch PCB and Z mounts. You'll typically have 3 spares. If you used all 13 screws, are you using this? |
| M3*6 **BHCS** | 16 | Aliexpress / Amazon | They are used on load cells. If you use a printed mount, check their BOM. |
| Nylon ties | *5** | Aliexpress / Amazon | You can typically get a truckload of these for about $5. I recommend you to buy more than 25. |
| RGB stick (158 mm for stock mounts) | 1 | Aliexpress / Amazon | I designed the entire frame for this stick only. Alternative mounts are coming soon, so stay tuned. |
