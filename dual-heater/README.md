# THIS IS A DUAL HEATER SECTION
The variation you're currently seeing was heavily inspired by a Trident with an X1C hotend.<br>
It supports the stock thermistor, and you can use the Tz2.0 hotend heater, or an X1C's.<br>
## IT DOUBLES POWER CONSUMPTION
Dual nozzle heater means it will double your hotend power.<br>
**BUY TWO 48 W HEATERS FIRST.** While some report that it handles 115 W of power with the CHC Pro, some boards may not.
## STOCK CONNECTORS CANNOT HANDLE MORE THAN 80 W
The stock connector is JST-XH(2.54 mm), only capable up to 3 A.<br>
Solder a 2-pin screw terminal with 2.54 mm pitch.
# USE THERMAL GLUE
My other hotend with a metal retainer scratched the ceramic heater too often.<br>
Use thermal glue, install your heaters, chuck in a thermistor, and THEN put on the silicone sock.<br>
Such glues like Steigner ST-1000 handle 750 °C. Buy one that handles temperatures higher than 500 °C.
